[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/LimeEng/DataStructures.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/LimeEng/DataStructures)

A growing collection of various datastructures implemented in Java.

As of now, only two datastructures are implemented.

* Stack
* Heap

The Stack has two (well, three actually) subclasses, each demonstrating two ways to implement it. They are however essentially the same, just implemented with two different subclasses of List.
  
The Heap currently only has one subclass, implemented with an ArrayList.
